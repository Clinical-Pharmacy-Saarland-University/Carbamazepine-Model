# Carbamazepine-Model
Parent-metabolite PBPK model of carbamazepine and its main metabolite carbamazepine 10,11-epoxide to be used as CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 inducer and victim drug in DDI simulations.

# Repository files
Within this repository, we distribute a whole-body parent-metabolite PBPK model of carbamazepine and its metabolite carbamazepine 10,11-epoxide. The model was developed using a broad range of published clinical studies. The model is able to describe and predict drug-drug interactions with erythromycin (CYP3A4 inhibitor), alprazolam and simvastatin (CYP3A4 substrates), bupropion (CYP2B6 substrate) and efavirenz (CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 substrate and inducer)
